# Data Visualization: Color

## Learning Outcomes

Learners will acquire the knowledge and fundamental skills needed to use color in data visualization. Through guided examples and exercises using pyobsplot (a Python interface to Observable Plot), participants will learn how create to different types of colormaps and when each type is appropriate. Specific outcomes include:

1. Be able to communicate how human color perception influences visualization
2. Be able to add color encoding to plots in pyobsplot
3. Be able to create visualizations with categorical and ordered colormaps
4. Be able to create visualizations with segmented and continuous colormaps
5. Be able to create visualizations with sequential and diverging colormaps
6. Be able to determine which type of colormap is most appropriate for a given data attribute
7. Be able to understand the pros and cons of rainbow colormaps
